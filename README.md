Bunny Run OpenGL Game

Description:
This repository contains the implementation of Bunny Run, an OpenGL game project developed as part of a graphics assignment. The game features a hopping bunny navigating through checkpoints on a wide road while avoiding obstacles, with the objective of achieving a high score. Leveraging OpenGL concepts such as shaders, transformations, and perspective projection, the game delivers a visually engaging experience with dynamic graphics and immersive gameplay.

Objective:
The objective of this project was to design and implement an engaging OpenGL game that challenges players to control a hopping bunny, collect yellow checkpoints, and avoid red ones to maximize their score. The game aims to provide an immersive gaming experience through dynamic gameplay and smooth graphics. Key objectives included implementing dynamic bunny movement, integrating checkpoint interactions, ensuring smooth camera tracking, and optimizing performance for seamless gameplay. Additionally, the project focused on utilizing shaders, implementing various transformations and applying perspective projection for object and scene rendering.

Specifications:
Bunny Run features include:
- Dynamic bunny movement with increasing speed.
- Yellow and red checkpoints placed on the road, affecting gameplay upon interaction.
- Smooth camera tracking to follow the bunny's movements.
- Checkerboard-patterned ground for visual appeal.
- Scoring mechanism based on bunny movement and checkpoint interactions.
- Integration of OpenGL concepts such as vertex buffers, shaders for lighting effects (diffuse and specular), transformations (translation, scaling, rotation), and perspective projection for scene rendering.

User Controls:
Players can control the bunny using the following keys:
- A and D: Move the bunny left and right, respectively.
- R: Restart the round to begin a new gameplay session.
  
This project was developed by Sogol Mehrabi and Tahira Kazimi as part of METU's Introduction to Computer Graphics course.
